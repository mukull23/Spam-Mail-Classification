# 📧 Spam Mail Classification using Machine Learning

This project builds a **spam mail classifier** using **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF vectorization**.  
It classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** with high accuracy.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessed and cleaned raw email dataset
- Converted text to numerical features using **TF-IDF**
- Implemented **Logistic Regression** for binary classification
- Evaluated the model with **accuracy score**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is `mail_data.csv`.  
If not included in the repository, you can download a similar dataset from [UCI SMS Spam Collection](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

---

## 📊 Results
The logistic regression model achieved reliable accuracy in classifying emails into spam and ham categories, demonstrating effective application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **supervised learning** techniques.
